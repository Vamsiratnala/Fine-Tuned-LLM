# Fine-Tuning a Language Model for the Medical Domain

This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on medical text data. The model is fine-tuned using a dataset related to the medical domain, such as PubMed articles, medical reports, or clinical data. The goal is to adapt a general-purpose model (like GPT-2, GPT-3, or LLaMA) to understand and generate medical content.

## Overview

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained language model on a medical text dataset to perform various medical NLP tasks such as:
- Text generation (e.g., generating medical summaries or reports).
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) and extraction of medical entities.
- Question answering for medical queries.

The code uses the **Hugging Face Transformers** library, which provides a simple API for loading, fine-tuning, and evaluating pre-trained language models.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `transformers` - For working with pre-trained models.
- `datasets` - For loading and preprocessing datasets.
- `torch` - PyTorch library for training.
- `accelerate` - For parallel training on multiple GPUs.

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate
```
## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available medical dataset to fine-tune the language model. By default, we use the PubMed dataset, which contains biomedical research articles. You can replace this with other datasets such as MIMIC-III, ClinicalTrials.gov, or a custom medical dataset.

The dataset should be structured as text data that can be tokenized by the Hugging Face tokenizer. Here's an example of how to load and preprocess the dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("pubmed", split="train")  # You can replace with any other medical dataset
```
After loading the dataset, we preprocess it by tokenizing the text and truncating it to a maximum length (512 tokens). This is done using the preprocess_function in the code.
Fine-Tuning
Once the dataset is ready, the next step is to fine-tune the model. We use a GPT-2 model in the provided code as a placeholder for any large pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA).

## Fine-Tuning
The fine_tuning_script.py script is responsible for the following:

Loading a pre-trained language model (GPT-2 in the code).
Tokenizing the medical dataset.
Fine-tuning the model using the Hugging Face Trainer class.
Saving the fine-tuned model to disk.
You can start fine-tuning by running the following command:

```bash
python fine_tuning_script.py
```
The script will:
Load the pre-trained model (gpt2 by default, but you can change this to GPT-3 or LLaMA).
Tokenize the dataset (e.g., PubMed).
Train the model on the dataset using the specified hyperparameters.
Save the fine-tuned model to the ./results directory.

## Evaluation
After fine-tuning, you can evaluate the model's performance on the validation set. The evaluation metrics used in the code include loss, accuracy, and any other custom evaluation metrics you choose to implement.

To evaluate the fine-tuned model, use the following lines in the script:
``` python
results = trainer.evaluate()
print(f"Validation Results: {results}")
```
## Model Saving
Once the fine-tuning process is complete, the model will be saved in the ./results directory. You can also upload the model to the Hugging Face Model Hub by setting push_to_hub=True in the TrainingArguments.

To save the fine-tuned model, use the following commands:

```python
model.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine_tuned_model")
```
This will save the model and tokenizer in the ./fine_tuned_model directory.
